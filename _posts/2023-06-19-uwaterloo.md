Hello. I am planning to join the University of Waterloo as a master's student in the following fall term. This is my first time studying abroad and being this far from home and I'm immensely excited about it. Even though I'm a bit scared and depressed about leaving home, the possibilities that the future hold are enough for me to keep on pushing.
