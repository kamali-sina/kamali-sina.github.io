It's been seven months since I last posted something here. Since then, I've moved from my country to Waterloo, Canada. I've been enjoying the calm here, but that doesn't mean I don't miss the chaos in my big city!

In the past few months, I've been working on a few projects, one of which is currently submitted to USENIX 2024, and we're awaiting results! I'm very excited to share the news on that one. There is another project that I've been working on for several months now that is very dear to me. I'm in the implementation phase of that project, and I hope to finish it soon.

That's all from me for now :D
