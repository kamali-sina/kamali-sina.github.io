## Who am I?

I'm Sina Kamali, an undergraduate computer engineering student living in Tehran, Iran. I first learned about programming in high school, but quickly realized I could create custom code to automate many of my daily tasks. I developed a passion for software development as I began to write more code throughout my studies and personal projects. I have developed several open-source projects which I encourage you to read more about on my GitHub page. Today, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Tehran, focusing on cryptocurrency and other related topics.

## What are my research interests?

Ever since I learned about blockchains, I've been fascinated by the possibilities and capabilities they have. Today I am interested in different topics in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, network security, cryptography, and computer networks. more specifically topics I am interested in are:

### Blockchains and Cryptocurrency

* Alternative consensuses (i.e. Proof of Human Work, Proof of Useful Work, etc.)
* Blockchain Development (i.e. Smart Contracts)
* Decentralized Finance
* Zero Knowledge Proofs
* ...

### Computer Network Security

* Cryptography
* Endpoint Security
* Information Security

### Computer Networks

* Peer-to-Peer Networks
* Cloud Computing
* Decentralized Services and Cluster Management
* Enhancing System Robustness in Decentralized Networks

## What are my other interests?

I have always been interested in games. I have developed a few games and love doing so. Although I have been less active in this field, I do hope to return to developing games as a hobby in the future.
