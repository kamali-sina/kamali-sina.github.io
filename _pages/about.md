## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Sina Kamali, an undergraduate computer engineering student living in Tehran, Iran. I first learned about programming in high school, but quickly realized I needed could create custom code to automate many of my daily tasks. I developed a passion for software development as I began to write more code throughout my studies and personal projects. Today, I work as an undergraduate research assistant focusing on cryptocurrency and other related topics.
